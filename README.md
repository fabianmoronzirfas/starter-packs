Starter Packs for building web stuff right away  
===============================================


To get this fully started you need to install first, homebrew, nodejs, bower, grunt-cli and the http-server node module.  

Open Terminal.app and type or copy & paste the following lines.

install homebrew:  

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

install node with homebrew:

    brew install node

install bower grunt and http-server

    npm install -g grunt-cli bower http-server

Done.  

To get started with a starter pack run change into the desired folder e.g.  


    cd chartist-js

Then run  

    npm install && bower install  

Now you should be good to go.
